## This is just an exercise

1. Please, don't ask me so much (this time)... I'm a very beginner!
2. Further, Brian said: "Keep it simple"
3. So, this app is Very Simple

--- .class #id 

## What this app can do for you?

1. To explore which variables are most likely to predict Spam messages.
2. Each variable is the % of appearance of a word (the same variable's name) in the total number of words of the message.
3. DATA source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase.
